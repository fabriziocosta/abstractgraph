"""
Deterministic hashing utilities for graphs and general Python values.

Goals
- Deterministic across runs and platforms (no use of Python's built-in hash).
- Order handling by intent: provide both order-aware (sequences) and
  order-independent (multisets) combinators.
- Compact, bounded indices for downstream feature maps (via nbits).

Core building blocks
- canonicalize / canonical_bytes: Convert arbitrary values into a stable,
  type-tagged, JSON-serializable form. Handles scalars, containers, numpy arrays,
  bytes, and dicts (sorted by canonicalized key). This prevents collisions like 1 vs "1" and
  avoids platform-dependent stringification.
- hash_value: SHA-256 over canonical_bytes(value) → big integer (base 16).
- hash_sequence: Order-aware combiner for lists/tuples.
- hash_set: Order-independent combiner for multisets by hashing elements first
  and sorting the resulting integers before combining.
- hash_bounded: Map a large hash to a fixed bit-width with a reserved low range
  (returns in [2, 2**nbits - 1]), leaving 0/1 available for special features.

Graph hashing (label-aware)
- hash_node: Hash of a node’s own label combined with an order-independent
  multiset of (neighbor label, edge label) pairs. Uses degree==0 to detect
  isolated nodes.
- hash_rooted_graph: For each root, perform BFS to group nodes by distance and
  combine their node hashes per layer; then combine layers in order to form a
  rooted-subgraph hash.
- hash_graph: Aggregate information across the whole graph by combining rooted
  subgraph hashes along edges with edge labels, plus a multiset hash of all
  node labels. Finally bound to nbits using hash_bounded.

Notes and limitations
- Only the 'label' attribute is used for nodes/edges. For MultiGraph/DiGraph,
  adapt edge iteration to handle keys/direction explicitly.
- canonicalize does not special-case NetworkX graphs; use `hash_graph` directly
  when you intend to hash a graph object.
- Complexity: hashing all rooted subgraphs is roughly O(V·(V+E)). For large
  graphs, consider caching, limiting radius, or alternative summaries.
- Collisions: Cryptographic hashing minimizes but does not eliminate collisions;
  reducing to nbits increases collision risk. Choose nbits to balance size and
  collision tolerance.
